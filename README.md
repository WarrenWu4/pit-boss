# Pit Boss

Built on top of Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor

- Provides a more friendly GUI for key mapping
- Runs on start up


Misc Notes
Normal for backgrounds to fuck up a little bit when switching desktops. You can blame Microsoft for that :).
Until I create my own of virtual desktops on windows it'll be a little laggy. You can blame Microsoft for that again :).
